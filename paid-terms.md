# npm Paid Services Terms

These npm Paid Services Terms of Use (these _npm Paid Services
Terms_) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm Open
Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Paid Services_,
the private package storage, delivery, organization management, and
access control features of <https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and
the npm public registry at <https://registry.npmjs.org> (the _Public
Registry_).

These npm Paid Services Terms were last updated on
December 1, 2015.
You can review prior versions at
<https://github.com/npm/policies/commits/master/private-terms.md>.

You may only access or use npm Paid Services by agreeing to the npm
Open Source Terms as supplemented by these npm Paid Services Terms. If
npm adds any additional functionality to npm Paid Services, you must
agree to these npm Paid Services Terms to use those new features, too.
You add these npm Paid Services Terms to your agreement with npm by
using npm Paid Services with your account (your _Account_). These
npm Paid Services Terms then become a part of the contract between you
and npm, until you or npm disable npm Paid Services for your Account.

## Use of npm Paid Services

npm will provide the private package storage and delivery features
and services described in the public documentation for npm Paid
Services at <https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro> (the _npm
Paid Services Documentation_). npm grants you permission to use
those features and services.

npm will also provide the organization management and access control
features described in the npm Paid Services Documentation, and grants
you permission to use those features and services, for npm Paid
Services "organizations" to which your Account belongs.

Permission to use npm Paid Services is not exclusive to you, and you
may not transfer it to others. These npm Paid Services Terms do not
give you permission to give others rights to use npm Paid Services.
If you agree to a Payment Plan that gives you that right, you may do so
only according to that Payment Plan.

## Payment for npm Paid Services

Both your permission to use npm Paid Services and npm's commitment to
provide npm Paid Services are subject to these npm Paid Services
Terms, the npm Open Source Terms, and payment for use of npm Paid
Services by your Account under a _Payment Plan_. The Payment Plans are:

1. the npm Solo Payment Plan at
   <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan>

2. the npm Organizations Payment Plan at
   <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/organizations-plan>

You may not use npm Paid Services unless you or someone else has
agreed to a Payment Plan, enabled npm Paid Services for your Account
under that Payment Plan, and made payment.
